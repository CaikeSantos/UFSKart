<h1>UFSKart</h1>
<p>The UFSKart is a project of the subject "Organization and Retrieval of Information". The goal is apply the acknowledgment about B Tree, index, inverted list, binary search and more.</p>

<h3>Context:</h3>
<p>UFSKart is an extension activity created by a group of university students to foster connections among peers through kart races. With the project's success, the number of racers, vehicles, tracks, and races grew rapidly, leading to slowdowns in system operations due to the increased volume of data.

After analysis, it was identified that the latency issue is related to using sorted lists for index storage, which are no longer suitable for large data volumes. Therefore, the adoption of the B-tree structure was proposed to improve the efficiency of data storage and manipulation.

The B-tree is a balanced data structure that allows for the organized storage of large volumes of data in secondary memory, reducing disk accesses and enhancing the performance of search, insertion, and deletion operations.

This transition to the B-tree aims to optimize the UFSKart system, ensuring a better user experience when dealing with the growing data volume generated by the project's popularity.</p>
